        <h1 class="info" id="info">Brendan Fraser is a seasoned Canadian-American actor known for many roles.</h1>
        <p class="info-2"> He has been nominated for and won many major awards, most recently winning the Screen Actors Guild and Academy Awards for the 2022 film <i>The Whale</i>. He rose to prominence in the 90's after portraying a revived caveman in <i>Encino Man</i>. In the mid-90's, he also had starring roles in <i>Airheads</i> and <i>School Ties</i>. The latter were not incredible box office successes, but this did not stop Fraser.</p>
        <p>After the successes of <i>George of the Jungle</i> and <i>The Mummy</i> in the late 90's, Fraser was established as a star. He went on to give many more memorable performances in the coming years, such as in <i>Blast from the Past</i> and <i>Bedazzled</i>. </p>
        <p>In the early 2000's, Fraser starred on stage in <i>Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</i>, as well as making many more film and TV appearances. His stint on <i>Scrubs</i> is legendary with fans to this day. <i>Inkheart</i> and <i>Journey to the Center of the Earth</i> were two novels adapted for film featuring Fraser.</p>
        <p>Fraser's career fluctuated for about a decade between 2010-2020. Most of the films he was in were not very successful, and then in 2018 Fraser came out with allegations against a Hollywood bigwig. Hollywood treated him terribly for being vocal about his experiences as a survivor of abuse. Thankfully, Fraser did not let this stop him.</p>
        <p>When the 2020s rolled around, so did what his fans have dubbed "The Brennaisance". Fraser made a comeback in films such as <i>No Sudden Move</i> and Darren Aronofsky's <i>The Whale</i>. His performance in The Whale was critically acclaimed and he recieved a six-minute standing ovation at the premiere at the Venice International Film Festival. This is typically noted as the turning point in his modern career. He also had a role in the hugely popular <i>Killers of the Flower Moon</i>, and even though it was not a huge part, he stood out to critics and viewers alike.</p>
        <p>As for the future, it looks so bright he has to wear shades. Fans both old and new alike are looking forward to Fraser's next performances. <i>Brothers</i>, directed by Max Barbakow, is set to release this year. <i>Rental Family</i>, directed by Hikari, is in post-production, and <i>Pressure</i>, where he will be portraying Dwight D. Eisenhower, is in pre-production.</p>
